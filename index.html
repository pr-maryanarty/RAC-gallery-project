                    Hello, my name is Mariana Dementeva, please find the gallery
                    of my projects down below, if you click "see more" you can
                    read on a bit about the process of project making. I
                    included +2 projects outside of the scope of FAC
                    application.

                        This is a landing page for my meme page. It contains
                        basic html structure, CSS styling, links, and a
                        functional button. This page I created as part of
                        SheCodes course on basic HTML and CSS.

                        This is my project of creating "weather" website. This
                        page I created as part of SheCodes course on foundations
                        of Front-End. I used API, JS - objects, arrays,
                        functions, submit, search. The project was challenging
                        because I had to encounter some technologies and
                        concepts for the fisrt time.

                        Hobby page - is a pretty simple HTML, CSS page, mainly
                        consisting of html tags and some CSS styling, it
                        includes just a fraction of JS - the date is displayed
                        at the bottom of the page. It was a good warm up, just
                        to see the result instantly.

                        Project Gallery - Flex-box based page, great way to
                        practise setting up flex box and play with its
                        properties. JS here is a bit more challenging. In order
                        to get button “show more” to word I had to implement
                        eventListener, Loop cycle and “hide/show” class names.

                        Movie Data - is a project that made me feel as if I
                        started from scratch but was able to reach brand new
                        levels. It was really mind-blowing not to get stuck
                        (which I did multiple times). Basic structure of a task
                        is rendering movies onto the page (using essentially no
                        html), interacting with a page by adding a new movie and
                        builting “sorting” feature as well, which would
                        reorganise the page without reloading.

                        Game - is a really fun and simple project, I had so much
                        fun creating it. It’s mostly consists of HTML structure
                        and JS coparison operator, basically we input “player’s
                        turn”, initiate computer’s turn (which is random) -
                        display results and score. I created a lot of functions
                        and used comparative operator, also reused code from
                        project gallery and movie data. Styling of the game I
                        personally really like, I think it turned out great.
                        Project includes READ.me where I described the proccess
                        of building the game.
