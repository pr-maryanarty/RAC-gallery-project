                        This is my project of creating "weather" website. This
                        page I created as part of SheCodes course on foundations
                        of Front-End. I used API, JS - objects, arrays,
                        functions, submit, search. The project was challenging
                        because I had to encounter some technologies and
                        concepts for the fisrt time.

                        obby page - is a pretty simple HTML, CSS page, mainly
                        consisting of html tags and some CSS styling, it
                        includes just a fraction of JS - the date is displayed
                        at the bottom of the page. It was a good warm-up, just
                        to see the result instantly.¬†

                        Project Gallery - Flex-box based page, a great way to
                        practice setting up flex box and play with its
                        properties. JS here is a bit more challenging. In order
                        to get the button ‚Äúshow more‚Äù to work I had to implement
                        eventListener, Loop cycle and ‚Äúhide/show‚Äù class names.
                        Flex-box makes the gallery responsive, although, I have
                        to admit if I had more time I would have implemented
                        media queries.

                        Movie Data - is a project that made me feel as if I
                        started from scratch but was able to reach brand-new
                        levels. It was really mind-blowing not to get stuck
                        (which I did multiple times). The basic structure of a
                        task is rendering movies onto the page (using
                        essentially no html), interacting with a page by adding
                        a new movie and builting ‚Äúsorting‚Äù feature as well,
                        which would reorganize the page without reloading.¬†

                        Game - is a really fun and simple project, I had so much
                        fun creating it. It mostly consists of HTML structure
                        and JS comparison operator, basically we input ‚Äúthe
                        player‚Äôs turn‚Äù, initiate the computer‚Äôs turn (which is
                        random) - display results and score. I created a lot of
                        functions and used a comparative operator, also reused
                        code from the project gallery and movie data. I think
                        the design of the game turned out great. The project
